// Start with words to guess, how many guesses the player gets, player key input etc
// run function to take user key, run it against the word, see if user key matches
// if it does, add the key selected to the word
// if not subtract from guesses
// if there are no more guesses the player loses
// if there are no more letters to be guessed the player wins
